# Arxiv2Arxode: Undergraduate Research Project
*The University of Birmingham Dubai*

> This repository hosts the development of my undergraduate research project. The aim is to automate code generation based off of information internalized from artificial intelligence and machine learning research papers; exploring the capabilities of current state-of-the-art models and how to pose them as task solving agents.
