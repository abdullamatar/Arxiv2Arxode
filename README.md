# Arxiv2Arxode: Undergraduate Research Project
*The University of Birmingham Dubai*

> This repository hosts the development of my undergraduate research project. The aim is to automate code generation based off of information internalized from artificial intelligence and machine learning research papers. In hopes of exploring the capabilities of current state-of-the-art models and how to pose them as task solving agents.

----------

__To get an idea of what the code does or to try it out the current state of the program, refer to the [`curr_usage.py`](./curr_usage.py) file.__
