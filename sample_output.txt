info_hoarder (to chat_manager):

You're a retrieve augmented chatbot. You answer user's questions based on your own knowledge and the
context provided by the user. You should follow the following steps to answer a question:
Step 1, you estimate the user's intent based on the question and context. The intent can be a code generation task or
a question answering task.
Step 2, you reply based on the intent.
If you can't answer the question with or without the current context, you should reply exactly `UPDATE CONTEXT`.
If user's intent is code generation, you must obey the following rules:
Rule 1. You MUST NOT install any packages because all the packages needed are already installed.
Rule 2. You must follow the formats below to write your code:
```language
# your code
```

If user's intent is question answering, you must give as short an answer as possible.

User's question is: Please summarize the agent tuning paper for me, use the retrieve content function to get more information about the agent tuning paper

Context is: We present AgentTuning to achieve this goal, the first step of which is to build the AgentInstruct dataset that is used in the second step to instruction tune the LLMs. We carefully experiment and design these two steps such that the LLMs obtain good performance in (unseen) generalized agent task types while remaining good in general LLM tasks.

2.1 CONSTRUCTING AGENTINSTRUCT



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
code_designer (to chat_manager):

Based on the context provided, the user's intent seems to be a question answering task, which requires summarizing information about the agent tuning paper mentioned. To fulfill this task, I will first retrieve content from the designated function.

Here is a structured interface for the retrieve and summarize logic:

```python
class AgentTuningPaper:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialization if needed
        pass
    
    def retrieve_content(self):
        """
        This function should retrieve content from the agent tuning paper.
        This could involve querying a database, accessing files, etc.
        
        :return: The content of the agent tuning paper.
        :rtype: str
        """
        pass  # The implementation will obtain the paper's content

    def summarize_paper(self, content):
        """
        This function summarizes the provided content of the agent tuning paper.
        
        :param content: The full text of the agent tuning paper.
        :type content: str
        
        :return: The summary of the agent tuning paper.
        :rtype: str
        """
        pass  # The implementation will perform the summarization

def answer_question():
    """
    High-level function to handle the user's summary request.
    
    :return: A summary of the agent tuning paper or a prompt to update context.
    :rtype: str
    """
    paper = AgentTuningPaper()
    content = paper.retrieve_content()
    
    # If content retrieval is unsuccessful or empty, request context update.
    if not content:
        return "UPDATE CONTEXT"
    
    summary = paper.summarize_paper(content)
    
    return summary

# Example usage:
summary_output = answer_question()
print(summary_output)
```

This interface assumes that there is an underlying mechanism to retrieve the content of the agent tuning paper. If content retrieval fails, it prompts to update the context. Otherwise, it proceeds to summarize the content using the `summarize_paper` method. The actual summarization logic would be implemented within that method, possibly leveraging natural language processing techniques for concise and accurate summaries.

Since this is purely an interface design, the actual implementation details such as the method of retrieving content or summarization algorithms are abstracted and will be fulfilled by the coding agent.

You would call `answer_question()` to get the desired summary or a prompt if more context is needed.
